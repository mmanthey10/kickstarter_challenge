# Analysis of Fundraising Efforts


## Overview of Project and Purpose

The project’s purpose is to provide analysis on the effectiveness of the client’s fundraising efforts relative to offer known results from previous fundraising efforts across various categories. 


### Analysis, Challenges, and Limitations

The analysis performed was inclusive of the relationship between fundraising outcomes and two separate variables: Launch date by month and dollar amount of fundraising goal.

#Outcomes based on Launch Date
Outcomes based on Launch Date analysis does not factor in the average amount of the fundraising goal for a specific month. As the analysis below will show (Outcomes based on Goal), the success rate of fundraising efforts is tied to the size of the fundraising goal. May is the month with the highest success rate. However, by adding in the average goal of failed outcomes, it becomes clear that this is not a result of the fundraising campaign beginning in May, but rather the campaigns that began in May had lower average fundraising goals across the board.

# Outcomes based on Goals
As it pertains to the “plays” subcategory, there is a limited sample of larger fundraising efforts (>$25,000). The success rates from these goal categories are difficult to draw accurate conclusions from as the sample size is small. 


### Conclusions from Outcomes based on Launch Date
The first conclusion that can be drawn is around the most common months in which a fundraising campaign has been started. In terms of total number of campaigns started, the middle half of the year is the most common for a campaign to begin. By splitting the year into quarters (i.e. Jan-Mar = Q1), both Q2 and Q3 were the most common quarters to begin a campaign with 432 and 358 campaigns started, respectively. The least common time to begin a fundraising campaign was in the last quarter (Oct-Dec) with December being the least common month.

The second conclusion that can be drawn is that there is not a significant difference in success rate by month. To say it another way, the month in which a fundraising campaign begins is not a good predictor of the success of that campaign.

### Conclusion from Outcomes based on Goals
One conclusion from this analysis is that the larger the dollar amount of the fundraising goal, the less successful the fundraising effort was. Above in the limitations section, the sample size was an issue for the larger fundraising goals, but there is a much larger sample size for the smaller goals. This part of the analysis shows that the larger the dollar amount of the goal becomes, the lower the success of the campaign is.



### Limitations of the dataset
As it pertains to the “plays” subcategory, there is a limited sample of larger fundraising efforts (>$25,000). The success rates from the dataset are difficult to draw accurate conclusions from 

### Additional tables/graphs that would provide useful insight
A useful chart to add to this analysis would be to display the relationship between campaign success rate and the amount of time between campaign launch and deadline. This chart would help a future fundraiser determine how much runway they should allow for to meet to their fundraising goal.

Large donations in fundraising are likely quite difficult to procure. Another useful table would contain the average donation amount by category (theater) as well as average number of backers. This analysis would allow a potential fundraiser to not only set a dollar goal, but also understand the number of backers that may be required in fundraising efforts.

Lastly, a table analyzing the geographic impact on outcomes would be useful in this analysis. Specifically for this dataset, the table would be filtered by country, category, and outcome.
